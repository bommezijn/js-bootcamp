## Slides

The eternal struggle of recursion

## Topics

### [Arrays by the coding train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQoUghHSxU)

what is an array? A place of storing multiple values (list of values) Within block quotes
elem in array have an order, crucial key aspect. Arrays start at 0.
```
var arrayName[key]
```

### [Object by the coding train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e5h4IGKZRY)

collection of name value pairs (and other objects (nested objects)) within curly brackets
Is neat way to collect variables that are doing something with eachother.

```
var objectName = {
    name: 'Nathan',
    dob: '21-02-1997',
    occupation: 'Student',
    bankAccount: 99999999,
    favFood: '🍜'
};

console.log(objectName.name + ' loves ' + objectName.favFood);
```

### [Read CH4 of Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)
All JS values have properties, exceptions are `null` and `undefined`.
Something that is mentioned again is the `.length method`

Methods:
Properties that contain functions are generally called *methods* of the value they belong to. Example: .toUpperCase is a method of a string.
